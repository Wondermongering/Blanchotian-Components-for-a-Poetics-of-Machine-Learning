## ✨ What’s inside?

| Component | Essence | File |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **Blanchotian Attention** | Each token attends to tokens‑present **and** to the very *lack* of attention it once gave.  Includes learnable void Q/K vectors and a decaying trace of past attention. | `Blanchotian Attention Mechanism.py` |
| **Orphic Embeddings** | Tokens are shaped by what surrounds them and what is forever hidden.  Rarity gates, isolation vectors, contextual inversion. | `OrphicEmbeddings.py` |
| **Neutral Loss** | Re‑centres error as a creative differential; stable log‑sum‑exp, label smoothing, disaster threshold. | `losses.py` |
| **Blanchotian Transformer** | Layers commune with **all** preceding layers—an endless palimpsest. | `The Infinite Conversation.py` |
| **Unavowable Community** | Ensemble whose disagreement is the signal; models converse through divergence. | `Unavowable Community.py` |
