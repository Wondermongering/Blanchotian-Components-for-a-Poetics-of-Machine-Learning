## ✨ What’s inside?

| Component | Essence | File |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **Blanchotian Attention** | Each token attends to tokens‑present **and** to the very *lack* of attention it once gave.  Includes learnable void Q/K vectors and a decaying trace of past attention. | `Blanchotian Attention Mechanism.py` |
| **Orphic Embeddings** | Tokens are shaped by what surrounds them and what is forever hidden.  Rarity gates, isolation vectors, contextual inversion. | `OrphicEmbeddings.py` |
| **Recursive Orphic Tokenizer** | Encodes tokens alongside what is conspicuously absent in their contexts.  Uses recursive n‑grams to track absence patterns. | `Recursive Orphic Tokenizer.py` |
| **Neutral Loss** | Re‑centres error as a creative differential; stable log‑sum‑exp, label smoothing, disaster threshold. | `losses.py` |
| **Blanchotian Layer Norm** | Normalises the centre while letting solitary features remain singular. | `Blanchotian Layer Normalization.py` |
| **Blanchotian Transformer** | Layers commune with **all** preceding layers—an endless palimpsest. | `The Infinite Conversation.py` |
| **Unavowable Community** | Ensemble whose disagreement is the signal; models converse through divergence. | `Unavowable Community.py` |
| **Blanchotian Style Transfer** | Apply Blanchotian components to reimagine text in a chosen style. | `Blanchotian_Style_Transfer.py` |
| **Différance Layer** | Meaning arrives only in the wake of what came before; outputs are forever displaced by traces of prior states. | `Differance Layer.py` |
