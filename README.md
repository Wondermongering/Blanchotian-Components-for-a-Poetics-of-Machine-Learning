<summary>📜 Philosophical Prelude — click if you wish to linger in the void</summary>

Conventional deep‑learning dreams of **convergence**—loss descending, weights crystallising, predictions sharpening to certainty.  
Blanchot’s oeuvre whispers the opposite: meaning **recedes**, thought hesitates, the word arrives only as absence.

This library therefore inverts the usual telos.  Its layers remember their failures; its loss cherishes deviation; its ensembles bind by mutual incomprehension.  A model built here does not *solve* a task so much as perpetuate an *infinite conversation* with that task.

## ✨ What’s inside?

| Component | Essence | File |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **Blanchotian Attention** | Each token attends to tokens‑present **and** to the very *lack* of attention it once gave.  Includes learnable void Q/K vectors and a decaying trace of past attention. | `attention.py` |
| **Orphic Embeddings** | Tokens are shaped by what surrounds them and what is forever hidden.  Rarity gates, isolation vectors, contextual inversion. | `embeddings.py` |
| **Neutral Loss** | Re‑centres error as a creative differential; stable log‑sum‑exp, label smoothing, disaster threshold. | `losses.py` |
| **Blanchotian Transformer** | Layers commune with **all** preceding layers—an endless palimpsest. | `transformer.py` |
| **Unavowable Community** | Ensemble whose disagreement is the signal; models converse through divergence. | `community.py` |
